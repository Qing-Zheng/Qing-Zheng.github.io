Landed in Chicago around 8:15. We took the L to the hotel and walked from Dearborn St. to Michigan St. by Millennium Park.

As you can see, I was noticeably upset by this.

We then went to the Institute of Fine Arts and enjoyed Picasso, Hopper, Monet, Renoir; there were quite a large amount of french impressionists there.

We then proceeded to be disappointed by the "global" options at McDonalds HQ.

Ended up going to the Navy Pier, walking around a bit, then took an architectural tour of the city by boat, which apparently I only listened to.

While finding cool things for Michelle to take pictures in front of, we found proof of the Stone Masons :D.

Then we proceeded to the Willis tower where I tried to conquer a fear of heights.
