Started off the day with UChicago which is not my bro's dream school! However, we only have a photo of her at Northwestern.

Then after all the college tours Michelle tried to shop for me, but we instead got her something... but at least the basement was cool! Only two places in the world I know that do this so far :D.

We then stopped at the Disney Store to get swagged up:

We encountered numerous stray pups:

We ate at what I'll call the Carmines of the Chicago, although their portion sizes cannot compare at all. Reminded me of the place that my cousin took me once. The lights were beautiful.

And the food was pretty lit as well:

Finally, a walk along the river with the lights of Chicago, it's bridges, the kayakers, and the city riverline.
